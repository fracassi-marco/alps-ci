# Public Assets

This directory is used by Next.js to serve static files.

Any file placed in this directory will be served at the root path. For example:
- `public/favicon.ico` → served at `/favicon.ico`
- `public/robots.txt` → served at `/robots.txt`

Currently, this directory is kept for Next.js compatibility and Docker builds.
